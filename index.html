<a id="what-is-trivial-about" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's Trivial_i1b about?</h3>

<p>Trivial_i1b is a project for Software Architecture course in Computer Engineering degree.</p>
<p>The main goal of the project is to develop a Trivial game, following the indications gaved to us. It is based on the Trivial Pursuit game, the typical game based on a board and with different questions that belong into different categories to be answered by the players.</p>
<p>The desktop application (from the second deliverable) is developed in Java, using Eclipse, making use of the Maven plugin and different testing tools to test the correct performance of the game.</p>
<p>For the third deliverable, a web application developed with JavaScript and HTML</p>
<h3>

<h3><a id="desktop-app" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>DESKTOP APPLICATION
  
</h3>
<p> This application is very simple and intuitive to use, since it is based in the original Trivial game. Everyone of any age can easily learn how to use it.</p>

<p>The interface of the game consists of 3 windows:</p>
<ul type=square>
<li><h1>Initial window</h1>
<p>The first window that appears when the application is run. In this window, you can enter your user name or create a new one, in case you are not logged in as an user.</p>
<li><h2>About</h2>
<p>In this window you can take a look at the information about the development team</p>
<li><h3>Create a new user</h3>
<p> If you want to create a new user, you must provide some personal data like your name, your email and a password. All this information is required to create the user.</p>
<li><h4> Play the game</h4>
<p>This is the main window of the application. Here is the board to show the player the different cells that can be selected.To start the game, the dice has to be pressed and the player has to decide which category he/she prefers. Depending on the category selected, one question or another will be retrieved from the database and asked to the player. The player has also the possibility of changin teh background colour of the window, selecting it with some buttons. The colours are those corresponding to the 6 different categories of the questions.</p>
</ul>
<h3><a id="web-app" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>WEB APPLICATION
  
</h3>
<p> The web application has a very simple interface. To use it, users will have to Register as a new username, or to Log In if they have already created one.</p>
<img src="http://www.ceintec.com/curso_de_javascript_y_html_presencial_en_bilbao_bilbo_vizcaya_bizkaia_3969895.jpg"></img></p>
<ul type=square><h1> Interface: </h1>
<li><h1>Initial window</h1></li>
<p>The first window that appears when the application is opened. In this window, you have two buttons:
      <li>Create new user: to register as new user in the game.</li>
      <li>Log in: to log in with your username and your password (you must be registered to have accesto the game).</li>
<p>In the initial window, you can also change the background color of the application if you want to have another color as background to enjoy the game. You have several options (the colours of the trivial game):
       <li>Red</li>
      <li>Blue</li>
      <li>Yellow</li>
      <li>Purple</li>
      <li>Green</li> 
      </p>
<li><h2>Create a new user</h2>
<p> If you want to create a new user, you must provide some personal data like your name, your email and a password. All this information is required to create the user.</p>
<p> Once the user is created, you directly acces to the initial window again, to log in an starting playing the game.</p>
<li><h3> Play the game</h3>
<p>This is the main window of the application. Here is the board to show the player the different cells that can be selected.To start the game, the dice has to be pressed and the player has to decide which category he/she prefers. Depending on the category selected, one question or another will be retrieved from the database and asked to the player. The player has also the possibility of changin teh background colour of the window, selecting it with some buttons. The colours are those corresponding to the 6 different categories of the questions.</p>
</ul>
<p> The WEB interface is different to the Desktop application one, but the different options in each window are almost the same, so it makes the application to increaise in usability.</p>
